### [TurtleBot3 Patrolling](https://github.com/shoaib6174/TurtleBot3-Patrolling) 

**Date:** April, 2024

**Overview:** In this project, I demonstrate the use of the Navigation 2 framework in ROS 2 through a TurtleBot3 simulation in Gazebo. My main goal is to enable the robot to autonomously patrol an area by navigating through four predefined waypoints on a simulated map. This project serves as a practical introduction to autonomous navigation, where I utilize Behavior Trees for decision-making and showcase both Python and C++ package usage within ROS 2. By leveraging the capabilities of the Gazebo simulator, I test and validate the navigation tasks, providing valuable insights into the fundamentals of robotic navigation in ROS 2.
