I am a passionate and results-driven computer science professional currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at North South University, Dhaka. I have honed my skills in various domains including artificial intelligence, data extraction, and software development.

Previously, I worked as a Junior AI Engineer at NITEX, where I designed and deployed an automated fashion attributes tagging pipeline using multi-modal models. I also developed a service for extracting data from PDFs in JSON format, utilizing various APIs and cloud technologies to ensure efficiency and scalability.

My contributions to the Google Summer of Code 2022 program with TensorFlow involved implementing the Swin Video Transformer models and converting weights from PyTorch to TensorFlow. Additionally, as a Research Intern at DeepPavlov.ai, I created dialogue graphs from the MultiWOZ dataset using advanced machine learning techniques.

I am proficient in languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript, with expertise in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. My experience extends to DevOps practices using Docker and Kubernetes, as well as backend development with FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

Beyond my technical skills, I am actively involved in leadership roles such as being a Qiskit Developer Advocate at IBM and a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. I am committed to continuous learning and sharing knowledge within the tech community.
