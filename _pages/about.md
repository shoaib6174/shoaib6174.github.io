I am an Engineer with a strong focus on robotics, multi-model models, computer vision, and software development. I have hands-on experience with **LLMs**, **VLLMs**, **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and **Nvidia Triton**, and have deployed scalable solutions using **AWS** and **Docker**.

I am currently a Research Assistant at the NSU Intelligent Robotics Lab, where I focus on AI for robotics, robotic software development using ROS2, simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and reinforcement learning. 

Previously, I worked as a **Junior AI Engineer at NITEX**, where I designed and deployed an automated fashion attributes tagging pipeline using multi-modal models. I also developed a service for extracting data from PDFs in JSON format, utilizing various APIs and cloud technologies to ensure efficiency and scalability.

My contributions to the **Google Summer of Code'22 with TensorFlow** involved implementing the **Swin Video Transformer** models and converting weights from PyTorch to TensorFlow. Additionally, as a **Research Intern at DeepPavlov.ai**, I created **dialogue graphs** from the MultiWOZ dataset using advanced machine learning techniques.

I am proficient in languages such as **Python**, **C++**, and **CUDA**, with expertise in frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. In robotics, I am well-versed with **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, **Nav2** and **ros2_control**. My experience extends to DevOps practices using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, as well as backend development with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL** and **ElasticSearch**.

Beyond my technical skills, I am actively involved in leadership roles such as being a **Qiskit Developer Advocate at IBM** and a **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador**. I am committed to continuous learning and sharing knowledge within the tech community.
